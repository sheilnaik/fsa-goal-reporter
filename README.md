# FSA Goal Reporter

A simple progressive web app for quickly composing soccer scoring messages for FSA games. Open `index.html` in a mobile browser, choose the scorer, assister, time, build-up notes, details, and goal location, then copy the generated message to share in your team chat.

The app works offline after the first load thanks to a service worker. Install it on your home screen for fast access during matches.
